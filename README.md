## üß™ How to Use

1. **Place the script:**
   ```bash
   sudo cp task-backup /usr/local/bin/backup_script.sh
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup_script.sh
   ```

2. **(Optional) Edit variables inside the script** to match your environment.

3. **Run manually:**
   ```bash
   /usr/local/bin/backup_script.sh
   ```

4. **Schedule with cron for daily runs:**
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   # Add this line:
   0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup_script.sh
   ```

## üì® Notifications

If the backup fails, the script will send an alert email to the configured recipient using `mail`. Make sure:

- `mailutils` or `mailx` is installed
- The system is configured to send mail (e.g. via postfix)

## üßπ Cleanup & Rotation

- Backups older than `RETENTION_DAYS` are deleted.
- Logs are rotated up to `LOG_RETENTION_COUNT` times.
